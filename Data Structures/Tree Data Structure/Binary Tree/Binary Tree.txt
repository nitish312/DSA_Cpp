                                                Binary Tree

Binary Tree : A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children. Which are refferd to as the left child (LD) and the right child (RC).

Important Binary Tree Terms & Properties :

1> A binary tree is known as Strick/Proper Binary Tree, where each node has 2 or 0 children.
2> A binary tree is knwo as COMPETE binary tree if all levels except the last are comletely filled and all nodes are as left as possible.
3> A binary tree is called PERFECT binary tree of all levels are completely filled with 2 childrens each.
4> Max number of nodes at level 'x' = 2^x
5> For a binary tree, maximum no. of nodes with height 'h' = 2^0 + 2^1 + ....... + 2^h
                                                           = 2^(h+1)-1
6> A binary tree is called BALANCED binary tree, if the difference between the height of left and right subtree for every node is not more than k (usually 1)

For node at indes i :
left child index : 2i+1
right child index : 2i+1

Binary Search Tree Data Structure :

Binary search tree : Binary search tree data structure, in which the values in the left subtree of every node are smaller and the values in the right subtree of every node are large.



Binary Search Tree Data structure algorithm :

1. Binary SEARCH  tree as dynamic node in memory
    Node(*left,data,*right)

    class TreeNode
    {
        1. int values
        2. TreeNode *left
        3. TreeNode *right 

        4. TreeNode()
        5. TreeNode(int v)
    }

    class BST
    {
        1.TreeNode *root

        2. bool isTreeEmpty()
        3. void insertNode(TreeNode *new_node)
        // depth first traversal approch
        4. a> void printPreorder(TreeNode* r)
           b> void printInorder(TreeNode* r)
           c> void printPostorder(TreeNode* r)
           d> void print2D(TreeNode *r, int space)
           
           // breadth first triversal approch
           e> void printLevelOrder(TreeNode* r)
        5. TreeNode* serch(TreeNode* r,int v)
        6. a> TreeNode* minValueNode(TreeNode* node)
           b> TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode*r, int v)
    }
