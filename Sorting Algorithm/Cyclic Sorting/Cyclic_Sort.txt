1) Cyclic Sort Algorithm : 
	Cyclic sort is an in-place sorting Algorithm, unstable sorting algorithm, and a comparison sort that is theoretically optimal in terms of the total number of writes to the original array. 

- It is based on the idea that the array to be sorted can be divided into cycles. 
- Cycles can be visualized as a graph. 
- We have n nodes and an edge directed from node i to node j, if the element at i-th index must be present at j-th index in the sorted array. 

*Time Complexity Analysis: 
-> Worst Case: O(n2) 
-> Average Case: O(n2) 
-> Best Case: O(n2)

*Space Complexity: 
-> Auxiliary Space: O(1)

#The space complexity is constant cause this algorithm is in place so it does not use any extra memory to sort.


2) Optimized Cyclic Sort : 
	This method is only applicable when given array values or elements are in the range of 1 to N or  0 to N. 
	In this method, we do not need to rotate an array.
